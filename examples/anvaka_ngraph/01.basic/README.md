# ngraph

`ngraph` is a collection of npm modules related to graph drawing. The author did
not provide "precompiled" version of library and encourages users to compile
what they need with [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

While it may be powerful tool for code composition and code reuse, it is still
not clear whether this approach is usable enough for everyone.
